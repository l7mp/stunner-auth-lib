# @l7mp/stunner-auth-lib

A library to generate ICE configuration and TURN credentials for the [STUNner Kubernetes ingress
gateway for WebRTC](https://github.com/l7mp/stunner).

```javascript
const auth = require('@l7mp/stunner-auth-lib');

var credentials = auth.getStunnerCredentials({
    auth_type: 'longterm,
    secret: "my-shared-secret",
    duration: 24*60*60,  // credentials valid for one day
});
```

## Installation

Install from NPM.

```console
npm install @l7mp/stunner-auth-lib
```

## Usage 

This library simplifies generating STUN/TURN credentials and ICE server configuration for accessing
the [STUNner Kubernetes ingress gateway for WebRTC ](https://github.com/l7mp/stunner) from WebRTC
clients.

The intended use is to ease the generation of STUN/TURN credentials and ICE server configuration
stanza in the WebRTC application server. The application server can send these back to the WebRTC
clients during the WebSocket/JSON call setup process. Clients can then use the STUN/TURN
credentials and ICE server configuration received from the application server to authenticate with
STUNner, in order to reach the WebRTC media plane deployed into Kubernetes behind STUNner.

The library will automatically parse the current STUNner configuration from the Kubernetes control
plane to generate the STUN/TURN credentials and the ICE server configuration.

### Configuration

The library depends on the current STUNner configuration for generating STUN/TURN credentials,
generated by the [STUNner Kubernetes Gateway
Operator](https://github.com/l7mp/stunner-gateway-operator). The STUNner configuration is usually
rendered by the gateway operator into a [Kubernetes
ConfigMap](https://github.com/l7mp/stunner-gateway-operator/README.md#configure-the-operator),
which is then picked up by the [STUNner dataplane](https://github.com/l7mp/stunner) to ingest
WebRTC media into the Kubernetes cluster. Suppose that this ConfigMap is named `stunnerd-config`
(this is the default name). The below Kubernetes pod template snippet shows how to map this
configuration into your WebRTC application server.

``` yaml
...
spec:
  containers:
    - name: <my-application-server>
      image: <my-application-server-image>
      ...
      env:
        - name: STUNNER_CONFIG_FILENAME
          value: "/etc/stunnerd/stunnerd.conf"
      volumeMounts:
        - name: stunnerd-config-volume
          mountPath: /etc/stunnerd
          readOnly: true
  ...
  volumes:
    - name: stunnerd-config-volume
      configMap:
        name: stunnerd-config
...
```

From this point, the STUNner configuration, as actually existing in the `stunnerd-config`
ConfigMap, will be mapped into the application server pod's filesystem under the path
`/etc/stunnerd/stunnerd.conf` and the full path will be available in the `STUNNER_CONFIG_FILENAME`
environment variable.  The library will pick up this configuration and use it to generate the
STUN/TURN credentials and full ICE server configurations necessary to reach STUNner.

If you change the STUNner configuration through the [Kubernetes Gateway
API](https://github.com/l7mp/stunner-gateway-operator/README.md#configure-the-operator) then the
new configuration will be immediately mapped into the filesystem of your application server. The
library includes a file watcher that will reread the configuration as it changes and the new
settings will immediately take effect: new client requests will receive the updated STUN/TURN
credentials. When no valid configuration file is found by the watcher, it falls back to the
[standalone mode](README.md#fallback-to-standalone-mode).

### Generating ICE configuration

The recommended usage is generating the [ICE
configuration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCIceServer) along with the
STUNner credentials in a single step and sending it back the WebRTC clients during call setup.

* Generate a full [ICE configuration
  object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCIceServer) on
  the [WebRTC application server](https://bloggeek.me/webrtc-server).
  ```javascript
  const auth = require('@l7mp/stunner-auth-lib');
  ...
  var ICE_config = auth.getIceConfig();
  console.log(ICE_config);

  // send ICE configuration through the WebSocket/JSON connection back to the client
  ```
  Output:
  ```javascript
  {
    iceServers: [
      {
        url: 'turn:1.2.3.4:3478?transport=udp',
        username: 'my-user',
        credential: 'my-password'
      }
    ],
    iceTransportPolicy: 'relay'
  }
  ```
* Send the generated ICE configuration to the clients during the WebSocket/JSON call setup process
  (e.g., during user registration) and use this configuration in the clients to initialize the WebRTC
  [`PeerConnection`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/RTCPeerConnection).
  ```javascript
  var ICE_config = ...; // read ICE configuration from the WebSocket/JSON connection 
  var pc = new RTCPeerConnection(ICE_config);
  ```

You can override the path to the STUNner configuration file by re-initializing the library:
```javascript
const auth = require('@l7mp/stunner-auth-lib');
auth.config.init({config_file: "MY_STUNNER_CONFIG_FILENAME"});
...
var ICE_config = auth.getIceConfig();
```

### Generating STUN/TURN credentials

Alternatively, you can simply generate a new STUN/TURN long-term credentials that you can use for
authenticating with STUNner.

```javascript
var cred = auth.getStunnerCredentials({
    duration: 24 * 60 * 60,  // lifetime the longterm credential is effective
});
console.log(`STUNner credentials: ${cred.username} / ${cred.credential}`);
```

Output:
```
STUNner credentials: 1652118264 / nRU+Iz2ENeP2Y3sDXzSRsFRDs8s=
```

### Stopping the configuration file watcher

When you no longer need the library you can disable it as follows.

```javascript
auth.config.stop();
```

This will stop the configuration file watcher and release all resources allocated.

### Fallback to standalone mode

Some may favor running STUNner in the [standalone mode](https://github.com/l7mp/stunner) in order
to be able to manually customize the STUNner dataplane instead of relying on the operator to render
the configuration. The library automatically falls back to using the standalone mode when no
configuration file is available under the path specified `STUNNER_CONFIG_FILENAME` environment
variable. For this, it the application server needs to have access to the [STUNner Kubernetes
`ConfigMap`](https://github.com/l7mp/stunner#configuration) mapped as environment variables into
the pod running the application server. The below is a Kubernetes pod template snippet shows how to
do this.

``` yaml
...
spec:
  containers:
    - name: <my-application-server>
      image: <my-application-server-image>
      ...
      envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: stunner-config
...
```

The library uses the following STUNner configuration parameters in fallback mode.

* `STUNNER_PUBLIC_ADDR` (no default, must be
  [customized](https://github.com/l7mp/stunner#learning-the-external-ip-and-port)): STUNner public
  IP address.
* `STUNNER_PUBLIC_PORT` (default: 3478): STUNner public port.
* `STUNNER_REALM` (default: `stunner.l7mp.io`): STUN/TURN realm.
* `STUNNER_AUTH_TYPE` (default: `plaintext`): [STUNner authentication
  mode]((https://github.com/l7mp/stunner/tree/main/doc/AUTH.md)); either `plaintext` or `longterm`.
* `STUNNER_USERNAME` (default: `user`):
  [username](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8489.html#section-14.3) for `plaintext`
  authentication.
* `STUNNER_PASSWORD` (default: `pass`): password for `plaintext` authentication.
* `STUNNER_SHARED_SECRET` (default: `secret`): the shared secret for `longterm` authentication.

By default, UDP is assumed as the STUN/TURN transport; see the [STUNner
documentation](https://github.com/l7mp/stunner/README.md) on how to enable STUN/TURN over TCP, TLS
and DTLS.  For most configuration parameters the library specifies sane defaults, which can be
overridden by the environment variables (i.e., the STUNner configuration), which can in turn be
further overridden in the function arguments specified on the library calls.

The below code will generate a full [ICE configuration
  object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCIceServer) in the fallback mode using
  the specified overrides.
  
```javascript
const auth = require('@l7mp/stunner-auth-lib');
...
var ICE_config = auth.getIceConfig({
  address: '1.2.3.4',            // ovveride STUNNER_PUBLIC_ADDR
  port: 3478,                    // ovveride STUNNER_PUBLIC_PORT
  auth_type: 'plaintext',        // override STUNNER_AUTH_TYPE
  username: 'my-user',           // override STUNNER_USERNAME
  password: 'my-password',       // override STUNNER_PASSWORD
  ice_transport_policy: 'relay', // override STUNNER_ICE_TRANSPORT_POLICY
});
console.log(ICE_config);
```
The below will generating a new set of STUN/TURN long-term credentials, again using manual overrides.

```javascript
var cred = auth.getStunnerCredentials({
    auth_type: 'longterm',   // override STUNNER_AUTH_TYPE
    secret: 'my-secret',     // override STUNNER_SHARED_SECRET
    duration: 24 * 60 * 60,  // lifetime the longterm credential is effective
});
console.log(`STUNner credentials: ${cred.username} / ${cred.credential}`);
```

Output:
```
STUNner credentials: 1652118264 / nRU+Iz2ENeP2Y3sDXzSRsFRDs8s=
```

Note that all manual overrides are available in the default mode as well.

### Caveats

* In order for the library to be able to read the STUNner configuration, the corresponding
  ConfigMap (i.e., `stunnerd-config`) and the application server must live in the same Kubernetes
  namespace (Kubernetes does not allow a ConfigMap to be mapped into a pod that exists in a
  different namespace). See the [STUNner
  examples](https://github.com/l7mp/stunner/examples/README.md) on how to configure the [STUNner
  Kubernetes Gateway Operator](https://github.com/l7mp/stunner-gateway-operator). to render the
  configuration into an arbitrary namespace from which your application server can pick it up.

* If you change the STUNner credentials from the Kubernetes Gateway API then old clients, which
  still use outdated STUNner credentials, will need to go through the authentication process
  (receive a new ICE configuration, re-request TURN permissions again from STUNner, etc.)
  again. Otherwise, they will time out on the next TURN permission refresh cycle. Currently it is
  the responsibility of the application server to orchestrate this process. As a rule of thumb, try
  to avoid resetting the authentication settings when active users are authenticated with STUNner.
